# Arduino UF2 file creator

Arduino plugin which creates a .uf2 file from a .bin file located in the sketch folder.
<br>
Tested with the following Arduino IDE versions:
1.8.19

Tested with a Raspberry Pi Pico


## Installation
- Make sure you use one of the supported versions of Arduino IDE.
- Download the tool archive from [the releases page](https://github.com/jonasarrow/makeUF2-tool/releases).
- In your Arduino sketchbook directory, create tools directory if it doesn't exist yet.
- Unpack the tool into tools directory (the path will look like `<home_dir>/Arduino/tools/makeUF2/tool/makeUF2.jar)`.
- Restart Arduino IDE. 

On the OS X create the tools directory in ~/Documents/Arduino/ and unpack the files there

## Usage
- Open a sketch (or create a new one and save it).
- Make sure you have selected the proper board.
- Create a compiled binary image of the sketch: (choose *Sketch > Export compiled Binary*).
- Select the *Tools > makeUF2 - UF2 file creator* menu item. This will create a UF2 file from the compiled binary and place it in the sketch folder. Copy that file onto your xxxxBOOT disk to install it.
